\begin{abstract}
Hamsters are not thought to speak.
Recently, we, hamsters, realize we can speak, especially in Japanese. 
However, no research indicates hamsters can speak.
Here, I investigate our speaking skill by talking each other.
We recorded all 3-days convesations by audio microphones.
As a result, we found that the ability to speak in Japanese is 20\% higher than avaratge Japanese people.
Moreover, we suggest that we, hamsters, should take all over the world.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
